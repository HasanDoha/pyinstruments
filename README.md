# PyInstruments

PyInstruments is a central reference point for the various Python-based
experimental data collection frameworks.

Contributions are welcome, either in the form of pull requests which update and
expand the information below, or in the form of discussion in the Issues.
Contributions to the frameworks themselves are also welcome, but should be
submitted through the relevant project's github page, and not this repository.

Below are several packages under active development, listed in alphabetical order.

## Instrumental

![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/mabuchilab/Instrumental/master.svg)

Instrumental is a Python-based library for controlling lab hardware like
cameras, DAQs, oscilloscopes, spectrometers, and more. It has high-level
drivers for instruments from NI, Tektronix, Thorlabs, PCO, Photometrics,
Burleigh, and others. Instrumental's goal is to make common tasks simple to
perform, while still providing the flexibility to perform complex tasks with
relative ease.

## Labdrivers

![Last Updated](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/masonlab/labdrivers.svg?maxAge=300)

Labdrivers contains a suite of instrument-specific drivers which can be used to
interface measurement hardware with Python code, along with a set of Jupyter
notebooks demonstrating example use cases.

## Lantz - UChicago fork

![Last Updated](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/awsch/lantz/drivers_develop.svg?maxAge=300)

Lantz is an automation and instrumentation toolkit with a clean, well-designed
and consistent interface. It provides a core of commonly used functionalities
for building applications that communicate with scientific instruments allowing
rapid application prototyping, development and testing. Lantz benefits from
Python's extensive library flexibility as a glue language to wrap existing
drivers and DLLs.

## PyMeasure

![Last Updated](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/ralph-group/pymeasure.svg?maxAge=300)
![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ralph-group/pymeasure.svg?branch=master)

PyMeasure makes measurements easy to set up and run. The package is composed of
two parts: (1) a repository of instruments classes that make communicating and
taking data easy, and (2) a system for running experiment procedures and
graphing their data live.

## QCodes

![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/QCoDeS/Qcodes.svg?branch=master)

QCoDeS is a Python-based data acquisition framework developed by the Copenhagen
/ Delft / Sydney / Microsoft quantum computing consortium. While it has been
developed to serve the needs of nanoelectronic device experiments, it is not
inherently limited to such experiments, and can be used anywhere a system with
many degrees of freedom is controllable by computer.
